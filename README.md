# Loan Default Predictor Web App (Group 5)

An interactive Streamlit app for predicting loan default risk using Ridge Regression. Built by Group 5 as part of an MSc Business Analytics project.

##  Overview
This app walks through the complete machine learning pipeline:
- Data upload and exploration
- Cleaning, preprocessing, encoding
- Feature selection using best subset selection
- Model training with Ridge Regression
- Model evaluation using RMSE, R², and cross-validation
- Interactive default prediction

##  How to Run
1. Upload your dataset on the "Data Import and Overview" page
2. Navigate through each page to preprocess, train, and evaluate
3. Use the "Predictor" page to estimate default probability for new inputs

## Built With
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
